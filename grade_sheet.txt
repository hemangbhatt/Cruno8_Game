I. Critical Errors

x   None

   No submission (skip rest) 0

   Program does not compile or does not run, or runs but does not
      produce output even after minor tweaks.  Grading based on effort.

      Removing one or two major bugs will fix this project. (40-50)
      Significant progress made, but major rewrite is necessary. (30-40)
      Not much progress made. (10-30)
      Barely started coding. (0-10)

      Score = 

      Rest of grade sheet is skipped.

II. Correctness

   A. Program as submitted.

      Did not submit mytest.cpp (Modify proj4main.cpp)  -3
      Program does not produce output or seg faults -5
      Player does not pick suit after playing Cruno8 -3
      Valgrind reports memory leak -2


   B. Test #0. Compatibility check with WrapperPlayer [proj4test0.cpp]
       
      No points. Tweak program as needed to compile.


   C. Test #1. Test pickSuit() [proj4test1.cpp]

x      pickSuit() selects most common suit.

      pickSuit() selects suit other than most common suit,
        but source code shows alternate selection strategy  -0

      pickSuit() always selects same suit and source code
        does not indicate any selection strategy  -5

      Program does not compile or run even after tweaking -5
      Program seg faults without producing output -5
      Program seg faults at the end -2
      Valgrind reports memory leak -1


   D. Test #2. Test CrunoDraw2 [proj4test2.cpp]

x      CrunoDraw2 makes next player draw two cards. 
      Next player also gets skipped -0

      No player draws cards -3
      Wrong player draws cards -2

      Program does not compile or run even after tweaking -5
      Program seg faults without producing output -5
      Program seg faults at the end -2
      Valgrind reports memory leak -1


   E. Test #3. Test CrunoSkip [proj4test3.cpp]

x      CrunoSkip makes next player skip a turn

      Wrong player gets skipped -3
      More than one player gets skipped per CrunoSkip -2

      Program does not compile or run even after tweaking -5
      Program seg faults without producing output -5
      Program seg faults at the end -2
      Valgrind reports memory leak -1


   F. Test #4. Test CrunoReverse [proj4test4.cpp] 

x      CrunoReverse reverses direction of play

      CurnoReverse does not always change direction -3

      Program does not compile or run even after tweaking -5
      Program seg faults without producing output -5
      Program seg faults at the end -2
      Valgrind reports memory leak -1


   G. Test #5. Test CrunoDraw2 combined with CrunoReverse [proj4test5.cpp]
      (Tests cmp() function for ties.)

x      CrunoDraw2 makes next player draw two cards. 
      Next player also gets skipped -0

      No player draws cards -3
      Wrong player draws cards -2

      Program does not compile or run even after tweaking -5
      Program seg faults without producing output -5
      Program seg faults at the end -2
      Valgrind reports memory leak -1


   H. Test #6. Test CrunoSkip combined with CrunoReverse [proj4test6.cpp]

x      CrunoSkip makes correct player skip a turn

      Wrong player gets skipped -3
      More than one player gets skipped per CrunoSkip -2

      Program does not compile or run even after tweaking -5
      Program seg faults without producing output -5
      Program seg faults at the end -2
      Valgrind reports memory leak -1


   I. Test #7. Check discard pile added back to game. [proj4test7.cpp]

x      Play continues after stock runs out

      Play ends when stock runs out -3

      Program does not compile or run even after tweaking -5
      Program seg faults without producing output -5
      Program seg faults at the end -2
      Valgrind reports memory leak -1


   J. Player strategies
 
      Overrode playOneCard() in CrunoPlayer and implemented at least one strategy

x      Did not override playOneCard() in CrunoPlayer  -3
      Overrode playOneCard() in CrunoPlayer, but always plays first playable card  -2
     

   Other errors (specify):



-----------------------------------------------------------------

IV. Program Design and Structure

x    Program design follows project design philosophy

    Overrides playGame() in CrunoGame to handle card actions  -8
        (Card actions should be handled by Card class functions.)

    Other errors (specify):


-----------------------------------------------------------------

IV. Coding Standards

x   Program has good indentation, comments and choice of variable names

   Poor/inconsistent indentation scheme  -2

   In-line comments are:
